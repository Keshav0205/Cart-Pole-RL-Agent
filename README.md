# Cart-Pole-RL-Agent
2D Environment: "Gym Cartpole-v0" in the presence of gravitty (vertically downwards)<br/> 
Action-space: Discrete <br/>
State-space: Continuous <br/>
Epsilon-greedy action selection, with varying exploration and learning rate. <br/>
Q-learning algorithm was used to train the agent over 1000 episodes with a discount rate of 0.99. After training, the agent was able to balance itself, with slight oscillations.
